This is a program implemented to perform the function of a checkout system found in shops. It uses letters in place of standard Skus. 
Each letter has its indivudual retail price, however, letters can also have a discount price attached to them when bought in larger quantities.

If I given more time, I will have made the following additional improvements to the design:

- Test to make sure any input that's not a letter reults in an exception e.g numbers and special characters.

- Make it more interactive by having standard input and output incorporated in the code base.
